3. Brief closing thoughts on the outcome of your program including: Developer notes looking back at all your work
   1. The challenges: developing securely takes planning, especially when the app is a web app. Developing web applications
is more complicated than initially thought. Making sure the database was only storing encrypted data was challenging.
   2. Surprises: The amount of work to get the security features working was more than we expected. 
   3. Important achievements you are proud of (if there are any you want to highlight): We are proud of the final project.
In the end, although personally identifiable information is collected, none is stored unless it is first one-way hashed.
Thus, even if a hacker were to breach the security, no usable information could be obtained. 
   4. Disappointments (if any):we were disappointed in how difficult it was to find a free system that could perform dynamic analysis.
      Additional free tools should be developed under GNU for those working on open source projects. 
   5. Disclaimers/caveats etc: Because we relied heavily on Meteor, if there are inherent flaws in Meteor's implementation,
the same flaws will affect this program.
